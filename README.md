## General Information
   *  This repository was created as a project to use **HTML5**, **CSS3** , and graphic images assests.  The primary goal is to refactor code to ensure the webpage is responsive and functional across all (size) user devices.
     The thrust of the project is to refactor some 'broken' html/css for a photography webpage.
   * The README.md utilized the Markdown language syntax
   * VS Code utilized for seamless edits to HTML and CSS.  Needed to include viewport in HTML with the @media tags in CSS so screen sizing addressed.  Then link tags for images needed some slight adjustment as 'resources' missing from path.
